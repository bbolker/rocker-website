RStudio-based instances now always require a custom password as an environmental variable `-e`:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=clever-custom-password rocker/rstudio
```

**If a password is not provided, a randomly generated password will be given in the docker log for the container**.  Check the terminal output or use `docker logs` command to check.

### RStudio without authentication

If you are certain you are running in a secure environment (e.g. not a publicly accessible server such as AWS instance), you can disable authentication for RStudio by setting an environmental variable `DISABLE_AUTH=true`, e.g.:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 \
  -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \
  rocker/rstudio
```

When you visit <https://localhost:8787>, you will now automatically be logged in as the user `rstudio` without having to first enter a user name and password.  (Note this example explicitly binds `127.0.0.1:8787` instead of the default `0.0.0.0:8787` that you get by using `-p 8787:8787` option.  This can prevent unintended external access to the instance, e.g. see [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3693434).)


### Custom usernames and user IDs

In this example, the default user remains `rstudio`, but now has a custom password.  (The password cannot be `rstudio` and is no longer set by default).  There is generally no need to set a custom user name, even when sharing volumes with the host user.  On Linux-based hosts, sharing volumes requires that the the UID on the container match the UID on the host, otherwise any files edited or created in the container will be owned by `root` instead. Check the user id on the host (`id`) and pass this value to the docker container as an environmental variable, `-e USERID=$UID`, where `$UID` is the local user id.

By default, all rocker images run as root.  This means that when running a terminal session such as `R` or `bash`, you will be a root user.  This allows you to easily install additional software on the container with `apt-get` and perform other admin tasks. However, if you are sharing a local volume with the host, any files you create or modify will become owned by `root`.  To avoid this, run interactive terminal sessions with the default user (`docker` for `r-base` containers, `rstudio` for RStudio-derived containers) when sharing volumes with the host, e.g.:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio --user rstudio rocker/verse bash
```

or

```bash
docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/home/docker --user docker r-base 
```

In these examples, we link the current working directory, `$(pwd)`, to a user-owned location on the image, and specify the approriate user name. 

For users accessing R through RStudio, this is not necessary.  The docker container will run as root, but a user logs in through the RStudio server web interface as the non-root user "rstudio", and thus any changes made to linked volumes will not alter file permissions on the home directory.  When running RStudio from a container, do no specify a user with `--user`! The container needs root to launch RStudio.  

## Root (sudo) privileges in RStudio containers

In RStudio containers, you can also add the non-root user to the `sudoers` group when the container is launched simply by specifying the environmental variable, `-e ROOT=true` in your `docker run` command.  Note that if you have disabled authentication and not specified a password, the password to use `sudo`as  the `rstudio` user will also be `rstudio`.
